# Joyjet's backend application test

## Level 1

We are building an e-commerce website. Our customers can:

- add articles to a virtual cart
- checkout the cart contents
- get it delivered the next day

The customer is charged the sum of the prices of each article in their cart.

Prices are expressed in cents.

## Level 2

Cost of delivery depends on how much we charged the custormer for their cart’s contents The more the customer spends, the less they are charged for shipping.

## Level 3

Some products are discounted because of a deal we made with the supplier.

There are two kinds of discounts:

- a direct cut to the article's price, e.g. get 50€ off your 300€ caviar tin and only pay 250€
- a percentage discount, e.g. get 20% off your 5€ creme fraiche and only pay 4€

Write code that generates output.json from data.json
